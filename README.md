# SoC-Noughts-and-Crosses

*30th October 2020*
*Week 6 [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)

During week 6 of School of Code we were first introduced to React. 

For our Friday hackathon, we (my partner @FreshtaEbrahim and I) converted [this OOP tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) into a React component based Noughts & Crosses game.

Happy Gaming :)
